#Security & usabilty

Making security usable and convenient for people is the most important aspect of information security practice and policy. 

- I have discussed the notion of “usable security” in the context of information security and further in relation to “convenience”. 
- In other words, practices and approaches to people-centred security in the context of information security. 
- I have chosed to approach the above statement from  one perspective, using an example from a Smart Home POV/context. (though one can approach with multiple pov's)
- Given that this is a broad topic, the key thing is that i have focused my essay using relevant literature and sources to make my arguments.
